# CE7454_DeepLearningProject_Group8
The deep learning project of group 8 by Shaun and Emily.

For Emily:

Apart from your network,

we need a train.py and an inference.py

we need a visualize.py to see accurately the location of (x,y) in the image, or we will train with the wrong area.

Please note that we only have four weeks left.

Cone on, my partner!

For Shawn:

train.py and inference.py is completed. I don't know the bounding box case, either. I will now start for my network.

Go on!
