# CE7454_DeepLearningProject_Group8
The deep learning project of group 8 by Shaun and Emily.

For Emily:

Apart from your network,

we need a train.py and an inference.py

we need a visualize.py to see accurately the location of (x,y) in the image, or we will train with the wrong area.

Please note that we only have four weeks left.

Cone on, my partner!

For Shawn:

I think both our networks and both bounding box and classification tasks can use one identical train/inference function.

I wrote the train.py and try to test use a one layer network first. But I got an error "RuntimeError: Expected object of type torch.LongTensor but found type torch.FloatTensor for argument #2 'target'" and not yet figured it out.

I made little change to the readimg.py, just to make it a function.

Go on!
