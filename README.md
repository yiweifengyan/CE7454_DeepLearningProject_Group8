# CE7454_DeepLearningProject_Group8
The deep learning project of group 8 by Shaun and Emily.

For Emily:

Apart from your network,

we need a train.py and an inference.py

we need a visualize.py to see accurately the location of (x,y) in the image, or we will train with the wrong area.

Please note that we only have four weeks left.

Cone on, my partner!
